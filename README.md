 The primary goal of this project is to harness the power of predictive modeling to assess state
 fragility, a critical aspect of global politics and international relations. In a world where the
 stability of a state can have far-reaching impacts– both within its borders and internationally
 understanding and predicting state fragility is of paramount importance. This project aims to
 analyze various indicators that contribute to a state’s vulnerability, employing advanced data
 science and machine learning techniques to not just interpret current states but also to forecast
 future trends.
 
 State fragility is a complex phenomenon, influenced by a myriad of factors including economic
 distress, political instability, social strife, and environmental challenges. Fragile states, marked
 by weak governance and inadequate service delivery, often face internal conflicts, refugee
 crises, and instability. They are susceptible to terrorism and transnational crime, posing global
 security risks.
 
 Understanding state fragility involves identifying at-risk states and their instability triggers. This
 knowledge is key for early interventions to prevent conflicts and their effects. Accurate fragility
 predictions are vital for efficiently allocating resources and aid. Through predictive modeling,
 that is, through forecasting the Fragile State Index (FSI) value for the next year, clustering
 based on indicators and clustering based on region and time-series classification, this project
 aims to offer insights for policy-making, aiding efforts to enhance global stability and prosperity
